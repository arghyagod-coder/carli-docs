# Install Arch Linux with Calam-Arch

As this tutorial is made for beginners, we use the Calam Arch installer. It is an excellent tool that can install vanilla Arch Linux with ease, rather than via the command line. Here’s how to use it.

**Note: The Calam Arch Linux installer ISO requires at least 1 GB of space. For best results, use a 1 GB USB flash drive or larger. Alternatively, burning an ISO file to a DVD also works, though DVD instructions are not covered in this guide.**

The Calam Arch installer ISO file needs to be flashed to a USB flash drive. There are many ways to create a USB flash drive with an ISO file. In this guide, we’ll focus on the Etcher application.

Why Etcher? It is cross-platform. So, no matter what operating system you flash the Calam Arch ISO file to, the instructions are the same. To get your hands on the Etcher application, head over to the official website. Download Etcher and install it on your computer.

After installing the Etcher application on your computer, open it up and follow the step-by-step instructions below to make your Calam Arch USB installer.
