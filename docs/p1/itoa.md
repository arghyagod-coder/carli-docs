# An Introduction to Arch Linux
The great thing about Linux distros is that there’s one for every skill level. If you’re new to Linux and want something that works right out of the box (or rather, the ISO file), then either Ubuntu or Linux Mint is a good choice. On the other hand, if you’re comfortable with Linux and Unix and you like to customize things a little (or perhaps, a lot), then you might want to give Arch Linux a try.

Arch is a distro that’s been around for about a decade, and tries to adhere to a “keep it simple stupid” policy. Simplicity, however, means something different to the Arch community than it does to the Ubuntu user base.

For Arch, “unnecessary additions, modifications, or complications” include a graphical user interface, wizards, or anything else intended to make it easy for Linux newbies to get their feet wet. Arch is targeted toward “competent” Linux users, people who are comfortable with the command line and editing configuration files.
