# Introduction

## Goal
The goal of this tutorial is to make you learn how to make a Arch Linux based Operating System (also called Distro/Distribution) as an Absolute Beginner. You will be given all of the guide and support as a beginner even if you have no prior experience to Linux.

This guide will follow running Arch Linux and understanding Linux Operating system in Detail, and then creating your own distributable Operating System.

## Target

The documentation is meant as study material for current and future developers of distributions working with Arch Linux. It is meant to be as complete as possible. We mean to read and gather other information from the net and you give a concentrated concoction of knowledge. The end result should be a working iso of **Arch Linux** at different levels of completion. There are many ways to build an iso. Can we explore them all? Is there a need to? Is there a “best practice” approach?

It is meant to be a long-term project. Releasing a phase/video/article monthly. We need to give the iso a name during our setup. We choose the name **“Carli“**

**Carli** stands for **Customized Arch Linux Iso.**

The **Github** Page of [ArcoLinuxISO](https://github.com/arcolinuxiso) is ready to receive any and all source codes needed for the project.
